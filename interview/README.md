# Implementation of the problem

So after the interview I had time to step away from the problem and look over it. I was right at the solution before, but didn't finish the logic for redistributing the cookies.

What I did was simply recalculate the cookies, instead of using a conditional, and loop through the remaining cookies to add them on.

## How do I run it?

To run this app, make sure to have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

and enter `node script.js`

## Additional Add-on

I added a newly revised version of the original problem, making it where the user can choose the amount of cookies.

Added a browser for the prompt feature.

## How do I run the add-on?

To run the add-on either use the live server extension on your vs-code, or right click and open in browser!
